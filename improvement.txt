Output Persistence to Files

Reason: The focus was to produce a minimal working prototype that generates and displays content quickly in the console. File I/O was deferred to keep the code simple and concentrate on core generation and async logic.

Configurable CLI Arguments

Reason: The initial objective was to provide an interactive proof-of-concept. Adding CLI argument parsing was considered secondary and could complicate the example for first-time users.

Enhanced Error Handling

Reason: Basic error handling was included, but extensive retry logic and detailed user feedback require more development time and testing to avoid masking issues and confusing users.

Caching Layer

Reason: Caching would improve performance but adds complexity. For the demonstration scope, fresh calls per request were acceptable to show live capabilities.
